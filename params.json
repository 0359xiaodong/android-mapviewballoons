{"name":"Android MapView Balloons","body":"This project provides an easy way to annotate map overlay items with a simple information balloon when using the Android Maps external library (`com.google.android.maps`).\r\n\r\n![Balloon](http://jeffgilfelt.com/mapviewballoons/balloon_holo1.png \"Balloon\")&nbsp;\r\n![Balloon2](http://jeffgilfelt.com/mapviewballoons/balloon_disclosure.png \"Balloon Disclose\")\r\n\r\nBasic Usage\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nCreate a subclass of `BalloonItemizedOverlay` in the same way you would do for the base `ItemizedOverlay` class. Rather than overriding `onTap()` (which is already implemented to invoke the balloon view display for each item tap), you override `onBalloonTap()` to handle a screen tap event on the balloon itself.\r\n\r\nThe data displayed in each balloon is mapped to the title and snippet arguments you provide to the constructor of each `OverlayItem`.\r\n\r\nThe repository contains a working sample application project which fully demonstrates its usage.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAuthor: [Jeff Gilfelt](http://jeffgilfelt.com)\r\n\r\nThe code in this project is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0.\r\n  \r\nCopyright (c) 2012 readyState Software Ltd.","tagline":"Simple information balloon annotation for Android MapView","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
